Run with node at port 3000, type '/?v=1' in the url. ?v=1-5 give the same image because only Happy.svg loaded for me so I didn't change it. I did not get to the edit button or the add comments. Loading the stars yellow background wasn't fully implemented either. I have my midterms this week and projects due next so I couldn't complete this. What is completed took around 6 hours. Thank you!
